1. Dependencies

 The following dependencies are automatically installed through the 'deps' script:

  - fsop Library
    * https://github.com/ucodev/libfsop

  - pall Library
    * https://github.com/ucodev/libpall

  - panet Library

  - rtsaio Library
    * https://github.com/ucodev/librtsaio

  - psched Library

  - psec Library

2. Installation

 The following command will fetch all the required dependencies and install the uSched services:

   # ./deploy


 Alternatively, each of the scripts invoked by 'deploy' can be executed separately:

   # ./deps
   # ./do
   # ./install
   # ./undo

 For Raspberry PI deployment, set the build target before any of the commands above:

   # ./target rpi


3. Specific Add-ons

 In order to install operating system specific scripts, run:

   # make install_classic_<distro>

 Where distro is the name of the system distribution. For example, to install Debian add-ons, run:

   # make install_classic_debian

 For operating systems incorporating the systemd:

   # make install_systemd


4. Starting uSched Services

   # usched start



5. Stopping uSched Services
